# ETL-Pipeline-with-SQLite
This project is useful for automating data processing workflows, making data more accessible and consistent for analysis.
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and SQLite. The pipeline involves the following steps:
1. Extract data from a CSV file.
2. Transform the data by performing cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, filtering, adding calculated columns (tax), and aggregating data.
3. Load the cleaned and transformed data into an SQLite database.

## Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
> pip install pandas faker

Note: sqlite3 comes pre-installed with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.
